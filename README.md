**Project Statement:** Forming social interaction through convenience

**Concept:** Modern life, for most, is orchestrated by a primary commitment such as education or employment which
will often dictate the availability of time and location. Given the dominance of such responsibilities, supplimentary
activities are left being forced to compliment existing circumstances.
